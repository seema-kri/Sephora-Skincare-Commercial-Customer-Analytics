## 📌 Business Problem & Dataset

Large e-commerce catalogs can look healthy in aggregate while individual products carry real dissatisfaction, pricing, and inventory risk. This project turns Sephora's skincare catalog and customer review data into **commercial and operational insights** to support merchandising, pricing, and inventory decisions.

**Data used:**
| Source | Fields |
|---|---|
| Product Catalog | Product ID, Brand, Category, Price, Ingredients, Stock Status |
| Customer Reviews | Product ID, Rating, Recommendation Flag, Review Date, Positive Feedback Count, Review Text |

**Scale:**
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Active Skincare SKUs | **2,351** |
| Customer Reviews | **1,094,411** |
| Average Rating | **4.30 / 5.00** |
| Revenue Proxy (Price × Positive Feedback Count) | **$192.54M** |

Four business questions guided the analysis: **quality risk**, **brand concentration**, **pricing power**, and **demand timing**.

### Additional Findings
- **Category performance:** Moisturizers ($61M) and Treatments ($48M) generate over 56% of total revenue proxy.
- **Demand seasonality:** Q1 is the peak period (329K reviews, $56M revenue proxy), pointing to a need for earlier inventory and supplier planning.
- **Brand scaling paths differ:** La Mer scales via premium pricing, while Drunk Elephant and Tatcha scale via review velocity.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

| Insight | Recommended Decision |
|---|---|
| 44 Attention SKUs ($6.27M at risk), 5 already out of stock | Freeze automatic replenishment on OOS Attention SKUs until vendor/quality review is complete; audit remaining 39 for reformulation or delisting |
| Top 10 brands = 40.89% ($78.74M) of revenue proxy | Reduce concentration risk by investing in mid-tier brand development so no single brand failure threatens portfolio revenue |
| $50–$100 Premium tier drives $78M (largest band) | Prioritize new SKU onboarding and marketing spend in this price band over Budget (<$25) and Core ($25–$50) tiers |
| Limited Edition items price 3% higher with no rating drop | Expand seasonal/Limited Edition drop calendar to capture margin without hurting customer retention |
| Cleansers lag at 66.3% recommendation rate vs. 77.2% for Treatments | Launch a category-level root-cause review for Cleansers (ingredients, packaging, positioning) before next reorder cycle |
| Q1 is peak demand (329K reviews, $56M revenue proxy) | Move procurement and safety-stock planning earlier; align supplier lead times to be Q1-ready by late Q4 |
| La Mer scales on price, Drunk Elephant/Tatcha scale on review velocity | Tailor brand strategy by driver — protect premium pricing for La Mer, invest in review/UGC growth for velocity-driven brands |
